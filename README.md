# Tubi Hangout Server

This project is the server-side component of the Tubi Hangouts POC. It's
an HTTP server that's hosted publically, so you may consider,
heading over to the [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/longshorej/tubi-hangout-chrome-extension)
instead.

## Developer Notes

* You'll need sbt
* To build a jar, run `assembly` from within sbt.
* To run locally, run `reStart` from within sbt.
